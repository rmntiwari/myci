Module:


An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.

Controllers always belong to a module.

Directive:

AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.

AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.

AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.

..............................................................

Model:

he ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

.............................................


Two-Way Binding:

both ways. If the user changes the value inside the input field, the AngularJS property will also change its value:

data binding:

Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.

.........................................

Data Model:
AngularJS applications usually have a data model. The data model is a collection of data available for the application.

.............................................

controller:

AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers.

The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.

..............................................

Scope:

The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.

The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.

In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}.


If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:

View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view.
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
Then the scope is the Model.

The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.

Filter:

Filters can be added in AngularJS to format data.

AngularJS provides filters to transform data:

currency Format a number to a currency format.

date Format a date to a specified format.

filter Select a subset of items from an array.

json Format an object to a JSON string.

limitTo Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.

lowercase Format a string to lower case.

number Format a number to a string.

orderBy Orders an array by an expression.

uppercase Format a string to upper case.


Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.

..............................................................................

Service:

In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.

The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:
